Display a meta field as a block on the front end, supporting ACF fields.

== Description ==

The plugin allows developers/users to display a meta field as a block on the front end, supporting ACF fields. It can be nested inside a parent block that has `postId`, `postType` context such as `Query Block` or stand-alone.

= How to use the block with ACF Field Types? =

1. Link type - the setting for the return value must be `Link Array`. The output markup is `<a href={url} target={target} rel="noreferrer noopener">{title}</a>`. There is no `rel` attribute if the `target` is not `_blank`
2. Image type - the setting for the return value must be `Image Array` or `Image ID`. The output markup by the [wp_get_attachment_image](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_attachment_image/) function. The image size is from the Preview Size setting.
3. Page link type, Post object type - The output markup for a single-value field is `<a href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a>`, and for a multiple-value field is `<ul><li><a href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li></ul>`.
4. Relationship type - The output markup is `<ul><li><a href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li></ul>`
5. Taxonomy type - The output markup is `<ul><li><a href={term_url}>{term_name}</a></li></ul>`
6. User type - The output markup for a single-value field is `display_name`, and for a multiple-value field is `<ul><li>{display_name}</li></ul>`. The known issue: the value is not shown in the editor due to permission in REST API, but it works fine on the front end, and it's safe to use.
7. For other complex field types, you can code a custom output markup by the hook `apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', 'field_value', 'post_id', 'field' )` or by the general hook in the advanced use cases.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

This plugin is created for developers, but end users can also use it.

= Does it support inputting and saving meta value? =

No, It does not. It only displays meta fields as blocks.

= Does it support all types of meta fields? =

Only simple types such as string, integer, or number can be used directly. Other complex types such as object, array need to be converted to HTML markup strings.

It supports all basic field types that can be retrieved value by the get_field or the_field functions. Some complex field types like image, link, page_link, post_object, relationship, taxonomy, and user are also supported.

= What are the prefix and suffix for? =

The value for those settings should be plain text. They're helpful for some use cases like displaying a value with a prefix or suffix, e.g. $100, 100px, etc.

= Does it include some style for the meta field? =

The block does not provide any CSS style for the meta field value. But it does provide a basic display inline style from the settings.
